    <!-- YOUR TEXT -->
    As Year 3 university students, our Critical Practice project focused on exploring the question: “Has technology made love easier or emptier?” We wanted to engage the public in thinking about how dating apps and digital platforms affect the ways people connect, communicate, and experience love in today’s world. The goal was to create an interactive experience that would encourage reflection, participation, and discussion.
    <br><br>
    For our interaction, we developed a multi-layered, hands-on setup that allowed participants to actively engage with the theme. One part of the setup was a board full of hearts alongside a phone interface with message bubbles, where the public could write their own responses and reflections. This allowed participants to express their thoughts, feelings, and experiences about love and technology in a personal and interactive way, turning the abstract question into something tangible and relatable.
    <br><br>
    To add another layer of engagement, we created a heart box with red and black hearts. Participants could choose a red heart if they felt technology had made love easier, or a black heart if they felt technology had made love emptier. As the hearts “fell” into the box, they created a visual map of opinions, allowing both the participants and ourselves to see the collective responses in real time. This made the interaction more immediate, playful, and visually compelling.
    <br><br>
    The combination of writing messages, choosing hearts, and interacting with the phone interface allowed participants to physically and visually engage with our central question. It also encouraged reflection on how digital communication shapes relationships and emotions in everyday life. By observing how people responded, we gained insights into the diverse and sometimes conflicting perspectives people hold about love in the digital age, highlighting the complex ways technology can both connect and distance us.
    <br><br>
    Overall, the project was designed not just as an art intervention, but as a platform for dialogue and reflection, where participation itself became a way of exploring and understanding the effects of technology on modern love and connection.
